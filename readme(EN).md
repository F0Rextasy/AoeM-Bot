# AoeM-bot

**AoeM-bot** is a bot designed to automate the **Age of Empire Mobile** game. It is developed using **Python** and the **PyAutoGui** library.

> ### Click the **KAYDET** button after every setting change. The bot performs actions by reading the **ayarlar.json** file.

> ### **Attention:**  
> ### While this bot is running, you cannot perform other tasks on your computer. The game screen must always be visible.

The bot will be continuously updated, and **New** versions will be shared as new features are added.

**Suggestions and feedback are welcome. You can reach me through the [Telegram address](https://t.me/aoembot_extasy).**

## How to Use the Auto Start Feature

![4](https://github.com/F0Rextasy/AoeM-Bot/blob/main/screeenshot/4.PNG)

To use this feature, keep the **Bluestacks Multi-Instance Manager** window open at all times. Duplicate the emulator with the same settings. This is important as the bot may continue running even if the window closes. The bot works by clicking the **START** button.
